# SIC-XE-Assembler
Requirements and Design:-

The requirement was to build a two-pass assembler for the SIC-XE machine using Python.

This is a SIC/XE Assembler with implementation of :

  •	Basic Assembler.
  
  •	Input format free.
  
  •	Error handling.
  
  •	Literals/org/equ support.
  
Input :

  •	Freely formatted SIC/XE assembly program.
  
Output:

  •	Object Code
  
  •	List File
  
  •	Symbol Table
  
  •	Addressing Mode (Flag bit)
  
    o	Direct Addressing Mode
    
    o	Indirect Addressing Mode
    
    o	Simple Addressing Mode
    
    o	Immediate Addressing Mode
    
    o	Relative Addressing Mode
    
      	Program Counter (PC Register)
